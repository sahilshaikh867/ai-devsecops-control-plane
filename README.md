# AI-Driven DevSecOps Control Plane

## Project Overview
This project implements an AI-driven DevSecOps Control Plane that governs software deployments by evaluating risk before production release.

## Key Features
- FastAPI-based backend with REST APIs
- AI-based risk scoring for deployments
- Audit logging for governance and compliance
- Web-based frontend dashboard
- Industry-aligned DevSecOps architecture

## Tech Stack
- Python, FastAPI
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- DevSecOps principles
- AI (rule-based decision engine)

## Project Structure
- backend/     → API and AI logic
- frontend/    → Web dashboard
- docs/        → Architecture documentation
- cicd/        → CI/CD design
- infra/       → Cloud infrastructure plan

## How to Run
1. Activate virtual environment
2. Start backend using Uvicorn
3. Access Swagger UI at /docs
4. Open frontend dashboard

## Outcome
The project demonstrates how AI can be integrated into DevSecOps pipelines to make secure, explainable, and auditable deployment decisions.
